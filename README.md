## How to play 
**WASD** to move / **MB1** to shoot / **MB2** for shotgun / **SPACE** to teleport

Kill the incoming enemies to advance levels, the speed of the laser and frequency of aliens (different type of aliens too) increase as levels are completed. When the enemies reach the other end of the screen, player loses a life. The rocks and laser instantly kill the player on contact.    

Occasionally the player will receive a power-up to teleport to game crosshair and upon getting 30 kills the player can use a shotgun which has a cooldown of 300 ticks. Rocks can collide with each other or the player can shoot at the rocks at least 5 times to blow them up.
